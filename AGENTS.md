# Fantasy Football Challenge Tracker - Agent Summary

## Project Goal
Create a simple, type-safe CLI tool to track specific fantasy football challenges for end-of-season payouts.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Input**: ESPN Fantasy Football League ID
- **Output**: Table showing 5 specific $30 challenges with winners
- **Data Source**: ESPN Fantasy Football API (via espn-api Python library)

### The 5 Challenges ($30 each)
1. **Most Points Overall** - Team with most total regular season points
2. **Most Points in One Game** - Highest single week score
3. **Most Points in a Loss** - Highest score in a losing effort
4. **Least Points in a Win** - Lowest score that still won the game
5. **Closest Victory** - Smallest winning margin

### Technical Requirements
- Simple CLI using argparse (league_id, --year, --private flags)
- Proper type annotations throughout (no `Any` or `# type: ignore`)
- Clean, readable code structure
- ESPN API integration for both public and private leagues
- Error handling for API failures

### Challenge Rules
- Only regular season games count
- Ties go to first team to achieve the result
- If still tied, payout splits
- Must use actual game-by-game data (no estimations)

## Current Problem
The current implementation became overly complex trying to extract individual game data from the ESPN API. The ESPN API's `box_scores` method and matchup data access proved difficult to implement reliably.

## Success Criteria
- Tool connects to ESPN leagues successfully
- Displays league standings table
- Shows challenge results table with real winners and values
- Clean, maintainable codebase under 300 lines
- Proper typing without suppressions
- Clear error messages for missing data

## Key Learnings
- ESPN API has limited/complex game-by-game data access
- Some challenges may require alternative data sources or different approach
- Focus on what's achievable with available API endpoints
- Prioritize code clarity over feature completeness

## Next Steps
Start fresh with a simpler approach focusing on what data is readily available from the ESPN API, and build incrementally.
